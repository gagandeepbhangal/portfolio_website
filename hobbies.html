          <p> </p>
          <p class="padded">Bhangra is a cultural Punjabi dance form. Much like how Hip Hop and Ballet area
          dance forms, so is Bhangra. I have been learning Bhangra since I was 14 years old and now I am
          a professional dancer on the team Nachdi Jawani Joshiley. In the video to the right, you can see
          me doing what I do best in the colour Royal blue! I have performed at hundreds of weddings, anniversaries,
          competitions and multicultural events. My most notable achievement is winning 1st place at the Circle City
          Bhangra competition in Indianapolis, US. Along with my 15 teammates, we trained tirelessly to put together
          one of the best performances in Nachdi Jawani's (my academy) history! Bhangra is something I will always love
          and one day pass on to my children.</p>

          <h2 class="padded">Soccer</h2>
          <p> </p>
          <p class="padded">Soccer is my most loved and oldest sport in my life. I have been playing soccer
          since I was only 5 years old! I have been part of the Brampton Youth Soccer Club for 13 years. I participated
          in House League where I have won the league title numerous times over the years. My most satisfying victory came
          in the 2013 league final where we (the underdogs) beat the undefeated Royal Blue team where I scored the winning
          penalty! The trophy for this is the large one in the middle of the picture on the right. My favourite player
          is Lionel Messi whom I consider the best player of all time. I aspire to be as technically gifted as he is both
          on and off the pitch. Although Messi is a forward, I primarily played full back as it was what I primarily
          exceeded at. Whenever I have nothing to do and want to get some exercise in, you can always find me on the
          nearest soccer pitch!</p>

          <h2 class="padded">Badminton</h2>
          <p> </p>
          <p class="padded">Badminton is a sport that made up my entire High School years. From grade 9, I picked up
          a Badminton raquet and turned out to actually be pretty good at the sport. I think I get it from my mom as
          she was extremely good at Badminton from a young age. From there, I met a friend who complemented my play
          style perfectly. I am more of an aggressive player with power whereas he was a more delicate player with
          precision. Together, we went on to dominate the Brampton Badminton scene for all 4 years. Every year, me and
          my partner would win MVP due to our success (as seen in the picture to the right). In grade 12, we even made
          it to the provincial finals! Thus, Badminton will always hold a special place in my heart and will be a sport
          I play and teach my children in the future.</p>
