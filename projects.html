        <h3 class="center">Python - Sudoku Game</h3>
        <img class="roundedEdges" src="images/sudoku.png" alt="Python Sudoku Game" width=100%>
        <p class="padded">Above is a Sudoku game that I coded using Python. This game implements multiple
        pre-built grids and generates the white spaces based on the difficulty the user selects. The difficulties are
        Easy, Medium, and Hard. The harder the difficulty, the more white spaces will be generated. To check the solution
        when the user presses "Solve", we loop over each space in the solution grid and the user's grid. If all boxes match,
        we output a victory screen. This code utilizes multiple classes as well as methods to organize the code elegantly.
        I implemented the GUI using the built-in <span>Pillow</span> library within Python. If you would like to check it
        out and download the game, the files can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/gagandeepbhangal">Github</a>. Enjoy!</p>

        <h3 class="center">Java - Paint Game</h3>
        <img class="roundedEdges" src="images/paint.png" alt="Java Paint Program" width=100%>
        <p> </p>
        <p class="padded">This game is a Paint program implemented in Java where the user selects either "Circle, Rectangle, or Squiggle" and
        can then draw those shapes on the canvas. To remember all shapes drawn, this program utilizes multiple data
        structures to keep everything organized and code minimized. The data structures used are known as: <span>MVC, Factory, Strategy
        and Command</span>. These three data structures save all shapes drawn which is useful for the "redo" and "undo" buttons.
        Also, this program has a save button in it. In order to properly save and load the canvas, the code stores the shapes'
        attributes in a ".txt" file and then reads this file line by line to recreate the canvas. Each shape has its own class with
        specific attributes of how the shape looks. When the user draws a shape, it is added to an Arraylist along with all its
        attributes. Essentially, the main focus of this project was to demonstrate the use of Classes and Data Structures to create
        a complex program with elegant code.</p>

        <h3 class="center">C - Prime Number Checker</h3>
        <img class="roundedEdges" src="images/prime.png" alt="C Terminal" width="100%">
        <p> </p>
        <p class="padded">This prime number checker program implemented in C utilizes forking to determine if a number is prime,
        a product of primes, or not prime at all. The "number of filters" as seen in the picture above is essentially the number
        of forks called in the program. Each filter removes all multiples of specific factor. The first filter will remove all
        multiples of "2" if it is a factor. The next filter will remove all multiples of "3" if it is a factor. The third filter will not
        remove multiples of "4" because "4" would've already been removed since it is a multiple of "2". Thus, each filter starts with
        the next prime factor. A prime number can be determined much more easily yes, but the point of this project was to do it using
        the concept of forking. Each time a new filter is created, it is created in a new process (hence, we fork). This allows us to
        run multiple filters simultaneously and thus giving us a faster run time. Each new process is the child of the previous parent
        process (the previous filter). If we hit more than 1 factor, we say the number is not a product of primes. If there are no factors,
        the number is prime, and if there is a factor (other than 1), the number is a product of primes. This program demonstrates my
        knowledge of forking and shows how I implement it within C.</p>
