        <p> </p>
        <p class="padded">Throughout my 6 years of coding, I have learned and become proficient
        in 3 major coding languages. These include: <span>Python, Java, and C</span>. The language
        that I have the most experience in is Java. I have been coding in Java since grade 11 as
        it was the primary language taught in High School. Furthermore, my 2nd year course "CSC207"
        was also strictly Java. My first year in university consisted only of Python and the second
        semester of my 2nd year consisted of C. I have coded various projects in all three languages
        which can be found on my <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page. Learning new languages
        is always fun to me and my next target is diving into <span>SQL</span>!</p>

        <h2 class="padded">Web Design</h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p class="padded">As of right now, I have learned the Web Design languages of <span>HTML & CSS</span>.
        Although coding languages such as <span>Python, Java, and C</span> are critical for a computer scientist
        to know, I felt that pairing them with Web Design languages would make me a well rounded programmer. Combining
        back-end coding along with Web Design helps make me a more complete computer scientist and able to cater
        to the needs of more companies! Believe it or not, this very website is my first web design project. In the
        future, I aim to learn more Web Design languages such as <span>Javascript</span>. As of now, I enjoy <span>HTML
        & CSS</span> very much and can't wait to add to my portfolio!</p>
