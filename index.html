          <p class="padded"><span>Bio: </span>  Hello world! My name is Gagandeep Bhangal and I am a Brampton born
          and raised computer scientist. Currently, I am entering my 3rd year at the University of Toronto Mississauga
          where I am double Majoring in Computer Science and CCIT (Communication, Culture, Information & Technology).
          My passion for coding tracks back to the first time I ever coded, my
          grade 10 "Intro to Computer Science" course. In this class we practiced using <span>Visual Basic</span>
          and I was immediately hooked. The entire process of thinking critically to solve problems and also thinking
          creatively to implement designs fascinated me. It was from that moment that I knew I wanted to pursue
          coding. Specifically, I enjoy problem solving and back-end coding languages such as <span>Python, Java
          and C.</span> I also prefer the industry of Computer Science over Computer Engineering. It is my dream to
          one day become a successful Software Engineer and pave the future of technology forward. Some of the many
          projects I have created can be found in the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> tab of my website!
          Besides coding, I also enjoy various activites such as Badminton, Soccer and Bhangra. These are further
          discussed in my <a href="hobbies.html">Hobbies</a> tab of my website! I hope you check it out and find
          out a little more of what makes me who I am today!</p>
